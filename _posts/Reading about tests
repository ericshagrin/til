Rails has an action "test", which makes it so you can write code such as "test 'should report error' do" and then jsut draft the test

Assertions are the basics of tests, and there's a lot of them assert_equal to assert_not_respond_to (obj, symbold, [msg] ) whcih ensure that obj doesn't respond to symbol

-n --name tags let you run a test of your choicing
you can also provide specifc lines 

bin/rails tests to run all of your tests
bin/rails test <filename containing tests cases> runs all the tests

Fixtures allow you to utilize data in your tests

Using test/system directory, system_test allows you to make real tests (running in, for example, a chrome browser)

test_screenshot and test_failed_screenshot can be used to see where your tests failed on the browser
