title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):
1. The similarity and interactions amongst symbols and strings

2. How raising errors work (i.e. NoMethodError) 

3. The similarities between Python and Ruby for object oriented programming and interactions between classes
